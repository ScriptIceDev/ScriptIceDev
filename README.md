Hi, I’m Tobi. I’m always interested in learning new skills, currently diving deep into all sorts of AI technology. Right now, I'm getting to grips with Python and Mojo. I’m keen to collaborate on projects that make a difference—be it in charity, medical fields, cross-disciplinary initiatives, education, microfinance, or crowdfunding. Want to reach me? Just ping me on Discord—it's the simplest way to get in touch. Pronouns: he/him (though I wonder why I need to mention it lol). Fun fact: I'm a perfectionist. Whether that's good or bad, I'll let you decide. -( •̀ ω •́ )✧
